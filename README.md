## 🧠 Workflow

1. **Start with a prompt in `prompts/`**  
   Example: “Fetch 5 years of S&P 500 prices and calculate daily returns using Pandas.”

2. **Use Codex or ChatGPT to generate/iterate code.**  
   Paste in reference code from any source (e.g., QuantDesk-scientist) as needed.

3. **Test in `notebooks/` or `scripts/`**  
   Save a
